Filtering out noise from a sinusoidal signal using a low-pass filter (LPF) with a Hamming window involves the following steps:

1. Generate the Sinusoidal Signal and Add Noise:
   Create a sinusoidal signal with a known frequency and amplitude. This will be your clean signal. Then, add some form of noise to this clean signal to simulate a noisy environment. Common types of noise include Gaussian noise or random noise.

2. Design the Low-Pass Filter:
   A low-pass filter is designed to allow low-frequency components (like the sinusoidal signal) to pass through while attenuating higher-frequency components (like noise). The cutoff frequency of the filter determines the point at which higher frequencies are attenuated. The Hamming window is applied to the filter coefficients to reduce the effects of spectral leakage.

3. Apply the Filter to the Noisy Signal:
   The noisy signal is convolved with the filter's impulse response (filter coefficients). This filtering process attenuates the high-frequency noise components in the signal while preserving the lower-frequency sinusoidal components.

4. Visualize the Results:
   Plot the original clean sinusoidal signal, the noisy signal, and the filtered signal on the same graph. This allows you to visually compare how the filter removed the noise from the noisy signal while preserving the original sinusoidal shape.

The Hamming window is used in the filter design to minimize the undesirable effects of abrupt transitions in the filter's frequency response. It reduces ripples and distortion in the filtered signal near the cutoff frequency. The windowing function shapes the filter's frequency response, reducing the influence of high-frequency noise and providing a smoother transition between the passband and stopband of the filter.

It's important to choose appropriate filter parameters such as the filter order (determining the length of the filter) and the cutoff frequency. These parameters should be selected based on your signal's characteristics and noise characteristics. Too high of an order might lead to excessive delay, while too low of a cutoff frequency might not remove enough noise.
